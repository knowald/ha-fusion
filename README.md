## Query strings

### View

To set a particular view when the page loads, add the "view" parameter. For example, if you have a "Bedroom" view, append the query string `?view=Bedroom` to the URL.

### Menu

To disable the menu button, append the query string `?menu=false` to the URL. This is useful when you want to avoid unwanted changes to your dashboard, such as on wall-mounted tablets.
